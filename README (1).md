# Steazr's Gambling Game
### Summary

A quick game I made. Choose between 1 and 2 twice, if they match with the house's number, you get paid. Also taxes. Still in hella development, I based this off of a project I made a few months ago. Redoing it because its hard to modify because the code was just spaghetti. This might be spaghetti too and I don't realize it, but it's better than the last thing I made. Of course, some features like shops, investment, and tax relief are depricated but those will be readded in by the time v1.0 rolls out. Taxes still exist though lol.
### Planned Features
I plan on adding back features from the original project, such as properties, a store, tax relief, etc.. A lot of this will be improved upon though. Most planned feature for the 1.0 release can be found and played with here: https://replit.com/@MiddleAncient/Unrigged-gambling-sim?v=1 
I also plan to add a happiness/sanity bar so that you have to spend money or else you will die. Paranoia MIGHT also come with a bar like that. Unlike the original project, you will be able to evade taxes but I haven't introduced that yet. Trust me, it'll come sooner or later.
### Modification Of The Program
I allow all modification of the program. It's easily modifiable, except for the main program. I forgot to have that allowed to be modified. That being said, I don't think there's much to modify as of v0.1 since it doesn't have a store yet. Though you can add that in yourself if you want. I'll try to make a modification guide soon, and the main file will be modifiable too, if I ever get around to that.
# How to install

You're all set, now you can play the program by running the application called "main"!  
You can move the game into different folders, but make sure to move all of      the files because if some are missing then the game won't work.  
If you get a screen that says this:   ![Windows Protected your PC](https://iili.io/UOo9h7.png)
Don't worry, the program is not a virus. You can run it by clicking on the underlined "more info".
